      "message": "Sorry, I didn\u0027t really explain.\n\nA couple of lines down from here the driver checks caps-\u003eis_pressure_supported and calls input_set_abs_params(... ABS_MT_PRESSURE ..) if the flag is set. This is actually the call which causes Android 5 to not register touches from the wonky touch controller.\n\ntouch_ic_init() calls through to the code which actually interrogates the product_id and can determine if the touchscreen is a known model or not. This patch clears is_pressure_supported if it\u0027s not a known model.\n\nSo the patch has call to touch_ic_init() before it checks the capabilities field, as the field might be changed as a side effect of touch_ic_init().\n\nI don\u0027t think there should be any ill effects from moving it up a few lines in this way, touch_ic_init() is called from a few places and it seems like an \"ensure the hardware has been queried by this point\" kind of function - although it\u0027s hard to tell exactly what the intention of the original driver authors were in some places! :)",
